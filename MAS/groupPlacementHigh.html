    <b>Classification:</b> Overestimators <br><br>
    <b>Description:</b> Based on your survey results, you are an Overestimator. Overestimators are easygoing and understanding, but stand their ground when they believe in something. Overestimators tend to be sensitive, detail-oriented, analytical, and creative. Overestimators are characterized as having been raised in stimulating environments where success is valued. The group was classified after the discovery that people perform differently when performing quick estimation tasks.
