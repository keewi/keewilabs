    <b>Instructions:</b> For this activity, your group will work together to most accurately estimate the number of dots that appear on the screen. At the beginning of each round, a &quot;+&quot; will appear to signal that the exercise is about to begin. When it disappears, you will have [TIME] seconds to count the dots. On the next screen, you will type in your estimate. The %Accuracy for all of your group members will then be averaged to calculate how many points your group gets. As you can clearly see, you cannot do well without everyone in your group doing well. There will be 1 practice round and 10 scored rounds.<br><br>
