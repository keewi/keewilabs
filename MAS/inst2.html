	<b>Instructions:</b> For this activity, your group will work together to find a series of numbers in succession as quickly as possible. At the beginning of each round, a &quot+&quot will appear to signal that the exercise is about to begin. When it disappears, you will have [TIME] seconds to click on all of the numbers in order (starting with 1). The Time Spent (TS) for all of your group members will be averaged to calculate how many points your group gets. There will be 1 practice round and 10 scored rounds.<br><br>
