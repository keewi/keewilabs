    Thank you for your participation in this experiment. In this study, we are hoping to understand how people react to underperforming members within their own groups. We are also trying to understand how being in a genetically-determined or environmentally-determined group can change how people react. In order to do this, the group you were assigned to was pre-determined and not necessarily based off your pre-screen results. The other members in your group were also simulated to emphasize the effect of being in a group with an underperforming member.
